* Documentation only guaranteed to include identifiers that are not part of the python standard library.
* Matches should avoid lines that are not directly relevant, including setting related variables, line comments, etc.

* Skipping python-short_url because no docs
* PTVS does not appear to be a python project
* supervisor doesn't have enough docs
* dateutil just doesn't have the right docs / good examples.
* neither does mechanicalsoup (very small)
* quads is also very small
* Redis got some examples, but kinda hard because most of the things just call out to redis

* just no docs in sixpack
* plyvel not python
